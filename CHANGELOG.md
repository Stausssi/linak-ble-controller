## [2.0.1] - 2022-07-27

### Fixed

- Removed unnecessary unsubscribe command that was leftover from previous refactor and causing a `bleak.exc.BleakDBusError: [org.bluez.Error.Failed] No notify session started` error.

## [2.0.0] - 2022-03-08

### Changed

- Replaced `--sit/--stand` commands with a more configurable list of favourites that can be actived with `--move-to <favourite-name>`

## [1.1.0] - 2022-03-08

### Added

- Client/server mode now prints heights on the client as well as the server

### Changed

- Updated to use the REFERENCE_INPUT characteristic which allows you to specify a height to move to. Makes the movement accurate to the millimetre and greatly simplifies code. Inspired by this project: https://github.com/pfilipp/idasen-controller

## [1.0.8] - 2022-01-07

### Added

- Add options allowing configuring base height and movement range (via PR from subraizada3)

### Fixed
